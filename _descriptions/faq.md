## Will my data be publicly available?
The short answer: No, by uploading your *FamilyTreeDNA* file you don't agree to make your data public or give anyone access to this data. It will be stored in your account and you decide with whom to share.

The longer answer: It can be public if you want it to be public. If you're logged in into *Open Humans&* you can [head to your personal data page, and make individual sources publicly available](https://www.openhumans.org/member/me/data/). If that's too much genome sharing for you, you can also [see if there are individual projects or studies with which you want to share your genome](https://www.openhumans.org/explore-share/).

## Where do I find the raw data I'm supposed to upload?
If you [head to the *FamilyTreeDNA* website you should find a link](https://my.familytreedna.com/family-finder/downloads.aspx) that allows you to download your data.

We'd ideally be interested in your *Raw Data Concatenated*. Your  download should be of a single file that ends in `*.gz`.

## Help, there are multiple download links
You should see two main categories on the [*FamilyTreeDNA* download page](https://my.familytreedna.com/family-finder/downloads.aspx). Once is the `Build 37` files, the other is the `Build 36` files. Both `Build 37` and `Build 36` are accepted, though we recommend `Build 37`. You should also go for the `Raw Concatenated Data` file, as this contains all your variants across all chromosomes.

## How-to get in touch:
This *Open Humans* project is run by Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, you can reach him via email at `bastian@openhumans.org`, or even quicker via Twitter under @[gedankenstuecke](http://www.twitter.com/gedankenstuecke).
